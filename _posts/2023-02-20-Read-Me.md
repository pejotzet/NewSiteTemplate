This is template of a [Jekyll][Jekyll] static site. 
It is founded on Jekyll's [Minimal Mistakes Theme][mmtheme] and is a follow-up of [Minimal Mistakes Template][mmtemplate] supplemented with the interface of [Development Containers][DevContainers] for easy [Visual Studio Code][VSCode] site authoring.

<!-- You need Visual Studio Code and Docker to develop your site locally with this template.  -->
[VSCode]: (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[DevContainers]: (https://containers.dev/)
[Jekyll]: (https://jekyllrb.com/)

This project is [hosted on GitHub][github] and its demo
generated by the [GitHub Actions][gh-actions] is available at [project's GitHub page][gh-page].

## Generating the website locally

You need Docker and Visual Studio Code. 
<!-- Network access is required only to setup of  the development environment and obviously, to publish the website. The build and preview cycle may be realized offline.
 -->
Download this repository as [ZIP][zip-repo] and unpack archive in some **empty** folder.
Remove hidden folders `.git` and `.github`, then start
VScode
```
code .
```
Open folder in `Dev Container` (the appropriate dialog should appear, otherwise press green icon in left down corner).
Building the container for the first time may take substantial time. Please be patient and wait uttil `postCreate` and `postStart` scripts will finish their jobs.
When you will see the Jekyll version displayed, it means that the `Dev Container` is up.
Please open the terminal (in VSCode) and start continuous build and watch process by running
```
srcipts/watch
```
The `watch` script internally calls Jekyll site generator in continuous build mode
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --force_polling --livereload
```
The live output is accessible in your default browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) or in a browser built-in into VSCode.
Now you can stop live preview with `Ctrl-C` and `Reopen folder locally` (again green icon).
Now you can open the folder in `DevContainer` again to see how much time it takes to bootstrap already created container. Do not run live preview yet.

You should adapt `_config.yml` to your needs.
This is main config file that parametrizes the way the site is build.
Please note, that changes to `_config.yml` are **not** reflected in the preview - `watch` script must be restarted for that.
Please consult a very good [totorial of the theme][mmistakes-guide] in case of any doubts what values you can assign to the predefined variables.
Now you can regenrate site for new configuration

```
srcipts/watch
```
Section "[Authoring](#Authoring)" describes how to modify template in more detail.

At that point you can just jump directly to the [template usage guide](mmistakes-guide).
However, there are method that permit developing your website with less software installed on local system. The reguirement of constant network access requirement is the price you pay for that.
If you are interested, please continue reading.

[mmistakes-guide]: (https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)

## GitHub Actions

The described below method requires only installation of Visual Studio Code in your local system.
The container that builds your site is created in the cloud.
You can achieve this by activating GihHub Pages for your account (go to `https://github.com/<gh_account>/<repo>/settings/pages`).
This method can be well interleaved with local development.

Create new **Public** repository on GitHub with `.gitignore` template for Jekyll and no more files.
Then go repository `Settings -> Pages`. Select: `Source: GitHub actions`, then workflow type as `GitHub Pages Jekyll`, press button `Configure` and then `Commit` without introducing any changes to the presented configuration file.
You can check the status of build process in `Actions` menu.
The build should finish with a success, although no page was produced.

Now go back to `code`.
In file `_config.yml` set the following variables
```
url                      : "https://<gh-account>.github.io" #  "https://mmistakes.github.io"
baseurl                  : "/<repo>" # e.g. "/minimal-mistakes"
repository               : "<gh-account>/<repo> # e.g. "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes
```
Open terminal in `VSCode` and run
```
git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:<gh_accout>/<repo>
git pull origin main
```
Please note, that this causes that in local preview you should be opening `https://localhost:4000/<repo>`.

The built-in `code's` Git client should show you changes between your local and remote repository.
Select its icon on the left pane, select all changes by pressing `+` on `Changes` bar (it appears when bar is hoovered), enter some commit message and select `Commit` and `Synchronize` or `Publish branch`.
The commit auto-initializes the build task. You can check it progress in `Actions` menu.
Your new and shiny page is available at `https://<gh-account>.github.io/<repo>`.

## Remote Repositories

In fact, there is no need you to create a local copy of your repository and synchronize it with the remote via `Git`.
You can install VSCode's extension `Remote Repositories` to directly open your GitHub repositories.
Please note that when switching environments you should push changes, otherwise they remain local to the enviroment created by `Remote Repositories`.
By default, pushing changes will activate the build workflow.
Please consult the file `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml` and the corresponding documentation for other methods.
Leaving only `workflow_dispatch:` method that activates build by pressing button on the repositorys GitHub page.

## vscode.dev

Moreover, there is no need you even install Visual Studio Code!
Connect your web browser with [https://vscode.dev/](https://vscode.dev/), choose `Open Remote Repository` and select your repository (it is a two stage process, first you are asked for server - select GitHub, then enter your repository in a format `<gh_account>/<repo>`).
Now you may have a feeling that you are working locally with VSCode.

You can edit and push changes to your repository.
So in this method the web browser is the only software you need install locally to make development using `GitHub Actions`. 

## Codespaces


The previous non-local methods give you a very limited control over the container used to build your website.
The GitHub's builder uses some default container and, as developer, you have no control over it.
Unfortunately, the process of creation of a custom workflow based on **yours** container is not straightforward.
As alternative to `GitHub Actions` one can use `Codespaces` working environment.
In this approach there is no need you to install anything except the web browser.

Open your acoout page on GitHub (`https://github.com/your-account`), then select `Codespaces`.
Press button `New Codespace` and fill-in required information.
The virtual machine you've just hired in the cloud will start create DevContainer defined in the repository, just like your PC was in "[Generating site locally](#Generating-site-locally) approach.
Please be patient until `PostCreate` and `PostStart` sripts will finish their jobs.
Since then you can work on a remote PC as on your local machine.
You can start the `scripts/watch` to see online results of your work (please add the value of `baseurl` after the presented link if you see `404 not found` error).

The word of caution. Using `Codespaces` you are hiring virtual machine in the cloud.
This service is not free, although GitHub gives [you for free some minutes][gh-worker-limits] of worker time.
Please monitor your limits.

**You have been warned!**

Now we can go to more pleasant topic.

## Authoring of pages

You can remove or rename entries in the navigation bar by editing `_data/naviagtion.yml`.
Images used by your pages should be stored in folder `assets/images/`.
The input for Jekyll is prepared in [Markdown][markdownguide] - a very efficient markup language.
Jekyll processes that input and creates HTML output on a basis of templates defined inside theme.
Every input file is equipped with a front matter that tells Jekyll what template apply to its body and sets the variables parametrizing process of conversion.
Please watch [Mike Dane's Tutorial on Jekyll's front matter][frontmattervideo].
[Here][pagelayouts] you can find available page layouts used by `Minimum Mistakes` theme.
The simplest method to start authoring is to add your content to folder `_posts`.
Filename of each post should start with the date of its creation, so please stick to this convection.
In a front matter of the post you can set not only its title, but also assign category and mark it with tags.
The template has pages that display posts sorted according to the introduced by you taxonomy.
Your only task is to refer them in the definition of the navigation bar (`_data/navigation.yml`).
In a body of the post you can place text, mathematical expressions, images and videos.
[This explanation of theme helpers][themehelpers] demonstrates how to do it efficiently.
Jekyll also can handle collections other than posts.
They can be organized as independent units (like `Recipes` in this template) or be the fragments of some larger structure (for instance provided sample tutorials can be chapters of a book).
Unfortunately, Jekyll is a blog aware system, so posts collection is treated specially.
As a consequence, taxonomy does not work for other collections.
Harmonization of all collection types in planned in Jekyll 4.x.
Please refer to [theme's Quick Start guide][mmistakes-guide] for more in-depth information.

Happy authoring.
